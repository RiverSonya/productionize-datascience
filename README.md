# Productionize Data Science

This is an example to deploy iris model prediction.

The `notebook` section has the jupyter notebooks and the converted code to python.

Steps identified:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Save the model.
6. Predict on incoming set of new data.

The code also explain example to send data from html to Flask server to predict on new data points.
